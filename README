A very arseholish API to talk to Grooveshark servers in Python.

Do not use. Well, if you have to, here's some info about the files:
    o README - this file
    o shark.py - main Grooveshark Client module, with example usage in the main function
    o config.py - some constants needed for Grooveshark connectivity, and some other per-user config (like web.py targets)
    o web.py - a very badly named, Flask-based, MPD-queuing example use of the pythonshark library

Remember, if you use this, you can, and probably will get IP-banned by the Grooveshark servers, as you WILL be breaking their ToS. Just sayin'.
